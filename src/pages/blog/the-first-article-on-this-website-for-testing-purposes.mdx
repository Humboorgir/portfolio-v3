## Ayy!! What's up G's
This is officially the first article on my beautiful, amazing, fastinating website!
Note that I'm only adding a few of these test articles to see how mutiple articles 
look on my website, I'll get rid of them once there are enough articles for it to look good.

### Interesting idea
Now that I think about it, I could post a few short (but real) articles about really simple things like 
top 5 javascript frameworks (type sh)!!! :D Man I'm awesome
