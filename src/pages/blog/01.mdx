Note: This article walks through the process of creating reusable UI components from scratch to provide a better understanding of the concept. However, in a real-world scenario, you'd probably copy & paste common UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs, etc) instead of writing them from scratch. So the implementation isn't as time consuming as it might look like 😅.

## Introduction 🚀
You can think of React components as building blocks of the web.
A component can be a navbar, footer, form, button, or any other piece of the front end.

> Code reusability refers to writing code in such a way that it can be reused across multiple contexts with little or no modification required. This approach saves time on repetitive tasks, shrinks codebase size, and improves maintainability.

Reusable React components are components that can be used multiple times throughout an application to prevent unnecessary boilerplate.

Whenever possible, I prefer to create reusable components for common UI elements (e.g., buttons, text inputs, etc) and use them in the application like a component library, Instead of creating a separate component for each instance of the element. 
This approach makes the code base cleaner, reduces code duplication and scales really well.

Let's take a look at an example to help understand the concept.

For demonstration purposes, we'll recreate the list of buttons in the image below
![ThreeButtons](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wc65uw0uc9w2jowj4ean.png)

## Step 0: Creating a simple button component
First, we're gonna start off with the home button.

```tsx
// home-button.tsx
const HomeButton = () => {
  return (
    <button className="rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90">
      Home
    </button>
  );
};

export default HomeButton;
```

Then we will copy and paste the code for the remaining buttons and make the necessary modifications.

```tsx
// profile-button.tsx
const ProfileButton = () => {
  return (
    <button className="rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90">
      Profile
    </button>
  );
};

export default ProfileButton;
```

```tsx
// settings-button.tsx
const SettingsButton = () => {
  return (
    <button className="rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90">
      Settings
    </button>
  );
};

export default SettingsButton;
```

and this is how we would include them in our app:

```tsx
<HomeButton/> <ProfileButton/> <SettingsButton/>
```

And... boom! here it is.
![ThreeButtons](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wc65uw0uc9w2jowj4ean.png)

### Why this is actually a bad approach ❌
While this does work, it comes with a bunch of problems, one of the notable ones being too much unnecessary boilerplate.
We just created 3 separate components for essentially the same thing. Imagine you're working on a large application where there are thousands of buttons like this. Making a separate component for each one would create loads of unnecessary boilerplate and quickly turn into an absolute mess.

Not to mention, making modifications to the component would be an absolute nightmare. You'd have to go through the code base and modify each component one by one!

## Step 1: Making the button component reusable
First off, instead of including each button's label directly in its component, we could pass it off as a prop!

```tsx
// button.tsx
const Button = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <button className="rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
And then modify the code to look like this:

```tsx
   <Button>Home</Button>
   <Button>Profile</Button>
   <Button>Settings</Button>
```

Same result, better code.
![ThreeButtons](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wc65uw0uc9w2jowj4ean.png)

Now we've got 1 component instead of 3! That's a huge improvement, but we've still got a major problem: **Customization**.

## Step 2: implementing className prop
What if you wanted to customize a button's appearance, while using the same button component, without having to create a new component for it?

For example, let's say we want to make something like the image below.
![Two primary and one secondary button](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3qjot62gskm29m4lly35.png)
Well, with our current component, we can't! 
Because a fixed set of classNames is applied to every button element with no way to customize it.

Let's make it so that you can pass `className` as a prop.
(Like this)
```tsx
  <Button className="bg-neutral-700 text-foreground">
    Home
  </Button>
```

### Bad implementation ❌
Take a look at the button component below.
```tsx
const Button = ({ children, className = "" }) => {
  const defaultStyle = "rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90";
  // anything passed as 'className' is directly added to button's className prop
  return (
    <button className={`${defaultStyle} ${className}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
We're basically taking `className` as a prop and adding it to the button element's list of classNames.

Let's try applying text-black to the element to see if it works.
```tsx
<Button className="text-black">Test</Button>
```

Button element resulted from the code above:
```tsx
<button className="rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90 text-black">Test</button>;
```
Take a close look at the list of classNames above.

Expected behaviour: `text-white` should be replaced by `text-black`
Result: `text-black` is added but `text-white` isn't removed.

So in short, we've got both `text-white` and `text-black` in the same list of classNames which could lead to unexpected behaviour. 

To fix this, we'll use a library called tailwind-merge.

## twMerge (6.7k gzipped)
tailwind-merge is a library that allows us to merge two sets of Tailwindcss classNames into one.

for example:
```js
twMerge('bg-white text-white', 'text-black text-xl')
// output: 'bg-white text-black text-xl'

// notice how text-white was replaced with text-black?
// without twMerge, this would output:
'bg-white text-white text-black text-xl'
```
More about tailwind-merge [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)

In here, we'll use `twMerge` to merge the default classNames with the classNames provided as a prop (to prevent potential conflicts)

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

const Button = ({ children, className }) => {
  const defaultStyle = "rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90"

  return (
    <button
      className={twMerge(defaultStyle, className)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
There you go! Now we can use `className` without having to worry about potential className conflicts.

## Step 3: implementing support for attributes
We're now one step closer to the final result! But there's still a huge problem, what if we wanted to use other button attributes? like `onClick`, `onFocus`, `type`, `name`, or even our own custom attributes.
```tsx
  <Button
// not working
    onClick={onClickHandler}
    type="submit"
    custom-attribute="custom value">
    Button
  </Button>
```

With our current implementation, such attributes would not be applied to the button element. 

This is how you'd fix that:
```tsx
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

// "...props" gets all remaining props
const Button = ({ children, className, ...props }) => {
  const defaultStyle = "rounded-md px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-600/90";
  return (
    <button
      className={twMerge(defaultStyle, className)}
      // applying other props
      {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
First, we're extracting `children` and `className` from props here, and then getting the remaining props as `props` by using the spread operator, and then applying them to the button element with `{...props}`.

## Step 4: Improving Re-usability and Readability with variants
I would consider what we've made so far to be quite re-usable, but there are still a few things we can do to make it even better.

One thing that really reduces boilerplate is implementing variants for common variations of the UI component such as `size`, `color`, etc.

### Why use variants in the first place?
Using the className prop enables us to customize buttons when needed. But I prefer to only resort to it as my last option since it comes with a lot of boilerplate. If there is a certain button style (other than our default one) we'd want to use all over our application, we should create a variant for it instead of copy & pasting the list of custom classNames everywhere.

For instance, imagine a set of default (primary), secondary, outline and ghost buttons we'd be looking forward to use all over the code base.
![default, secondary, outline and ghost buttons](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k73av35zwaxnmou6fwgs.png)

This is how the implementation would look like:
```tsx
      <Button>Default button</Button>
      <Button className="bg-neutral-700 text-neutral-50 hover:bg-neutral-700/90">
        Secondary button
      </Button>
      <Button className="border border-black text-black bg-transparent hover:bg-black/10">
        Outline button
      </Button>
      <Button className="bg-transparent text-black hover:bg-black/10">
        Ghost button
      </Button>
```
It would look quite messy if we had to copy and paste the same set of classNames for each instance of the button.

What if we could specify each button's style by using a simple `variant` prop?
```tsx
      <Button>Default button</Button>
      <Button variant="secondary">Secondary button</Button>
      <Button variant="outline">Outline button</Button>
      <Button variant="ghost">Ghost button</Button>
```
Much cleaner now, isn't it?
Well, this is where variants come in handy!
In this example, we will implement two useful variants for our component:
`size` and `variant` (quite literally 😅)

In order to implement variants we're going to use **class-variance-authority**

### cva (756 bytes gzipped)
class-variance-authority is the main library we're going to use to implement variants.
More about class-variance-authority [Here](https://cva.style/docs/getting-started/variants)

The library provides a function called 'cva'.
This is how 'cva' is used:
```tsx
// cva returns a function after being called.
// in here, componentVariants is a function that returns
// a list of classNames after being called according to the
// specified variant.

// the first parameter is a list of classNames that will be
// applied to all variants! (like flex layout and transitions)
const componentVariants = cva('text-black',
  {
    variants: {
// variants such as 'size', 'color' etc are supposed to be here
      color: {
        blue: "bg-blue-500",
        red: "bg-red-500",
        white: "bg-white",
      }
    },
    defaultVariants: {
// We'll set the color to blue if nothing is specified.
      color: "blue",
    },
  }
);
```
Now we're gonna use componentVariants like this:
```tsx
console.log(componentVariants({ color: "red" }));
// output: text-black bg-red-500
console.log(componentVariants({ color: "blue" }));
// output: text-black bg-blue-500
console.log(componentVariants());
// output: text-black bg-blue-500
```
You probably know how it works by now
so let's use it to build different variants for our button component.
```tsx
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  `inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md whitespace-nowrap 
  ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none 
   disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 relative overflow-hidden`,
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-neutral-100 hover:bg-primary/80",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        outline: "border border-ring text-foreground bg-background hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "text-base px-3 py-2",
        sm: "text-sm rounded-md px-2 py-1.5",
        lg: "text-xl rounded-md px-4 py-3",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

const Button = ({ children, className, variant, size, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <button className={twMerge(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

**Explanation**: the first argument passed to cva, is classNames you want to include in all variants. In this case, that would be flex layout, border-radius, transitions, etc.
the second argument is an object in which variants are specified. In here, we've got two variants: 'variant' and 'size'.
variant can be: default, secondary, outline, ghost, link
whereas size can be set to: default, sm, lg
For instance, setting the size variant to 'lg' will apply 'text-xl rounded-md px-4 py-3' to the element.
defaultVariants is also an object that determines which variants should be used by default if nothing is specified.
In the end, we get the corresponding list of classNames from `buttonVariants({ variant: <variant> })` and pass them to twMerge, which will merge them with custom classNames if any are provided.

## Step 5: Implementing support for refs with React forwardRef
What if we wanted to us refs with our components? They're supposed to be 100% reusable so this should be a feature.

Picture this:
```tsx
 const buttonRef = React.useRef(null);
  
  return <Button ref={buttonRef}>Default button</Button>;
```
This can be extremely useful in components like inputs.

React's forwardRef allows function components to be given refs.
To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef():
```tsx
const Button = React.forwardRef(({ children, className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
  return (
    <button
      ref={ref}
      className={twMerge(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)}
      {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
});
```
(Make sure to import React if you haven't already)

## Step 6: Final tweaks

#### clsx integration

From the official docs:
> clsx is a tiny (239B) utility for constructing className strings **conditionally**.

```tsx
import { clsx } from 'clsx';

// Strings (variadic)
clsx('foo', true && 'bar', 'baz');
//=> 'foo bar baz'

// Objects
clsx({ foo:true, bar:false, baz:isTrue() });
//=> 'foo baz'
```

More about clsx [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)

Wrap className with `clsx` and boom! Now we can use the clsx syntax to apply classNames conditionally.

```tsx
    <button className={twMerge(buttonVariants({ variant }), clsx(className))} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
```

Since we're going to be using twMerge and clsx in all of our reusable components, it would be more practical to create a shortcut for them. In order to achieve this, we'll create a `cn` helper function that wraps the input in both `clsx` and `twMerge`

[Credits to ShadcnUI for the idea]

```tsx
// lib/utils.js
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
import { clsx } from "clsx";

export function cn(...classes) {
  return twMerge(clsx(classes));
}

```

Typescript version:
```tsx
// lib/utils.ts
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
import { ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";

export function cn(...classes: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(classes));
}
```

Finally, we edit our button component to use `cn` instead of twMerge and clsx

```tsx
import { cn } from "../lib/utils";

    <button className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
```
And with that, we've finished building our entirely reusable button component.
You can customize it in however way you'd like.
In the same way, you can build other reusable components (inputs, modals, dropdowns, etc)

Here's the final result:
<br/>✅ Supports custom labels
<br/>✅ Supports custom classNames
<br/>✅ Supports custom attributes
<br/>✅ Supports different variants and sizes
<br/>✅ Supports conditional classNames with clsx syntax
<br/>✅ Supports `ref`s

```tsx
import React from "react";

import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";
import { cn } from "../lib/utils";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  `inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md whitespace-nowrap 
  ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none 
   disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 relative overflow-hidden`,
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-neutral-100 hover:bg-primary/80",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        outline: "border border-ring text-foreground bg-background hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "text-base px-3 py-2",
        sm: "text-sm rounded-md px-2 py-1.5",
        lg: "text-xl rounded-md px-4 py-3",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

const Button = React.forwardRef(({ children, className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
  return (
    <button
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
      {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
});

export default Button;
```

Typescript version:
```tsx
import React from "react";

import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
import { cn } from "../lib/utils";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  `inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md whitespace-nowrap 
  ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none 
   disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 relative overflow-hidden`,
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-neutral-100 hover:bg-primary/80",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        outline: "border border-ring text-foreground bg-background hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "text-base px-3 py-2",
        sm: "text-sm rounded-md px-2 py-1.5",
        lg: "text-xl rounded-md px-4 py-3",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

type ButtonProps = React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> &
  VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>;
  
const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ children, className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        ref={ref}
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
        {...props}>
        {children}
      </button>
    );
  }
);

export default Button;
```
