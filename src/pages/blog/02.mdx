Note: This article walks through the process of creating reusable UI components from scratch to provide a better understanding of the concept. However, in a real-world scenario, you'd probably copy & paste common UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs, etc) instead of writing them from scratch. So the implementation isn't as time consuming as it might look like ðŸ˜….

## Introduction ðŸš€
You can think of React components as building blocks of the web.
A component can be a navbar, footer, form, button, or any other piece of the front end.

> They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

> Code reusability refers to writing code in such a way that it can be reused across multiple contexts with little or no modification required. This approach saves time on repetitive tasks, shrinks codebase size, and improves maintainability.

Reusable React components are components that can be used multiple times throughout an application to prevent unnecessary boilerplate.

Whenever possible, I prefer to create reusable components for common UI elements (e.g., buttons, text inputs, etc) and use them in the application like a component library, Instead of creating a separate component for each instance of the element. 
This approach makes the code base cleaner, reduces code duplication and scales really well.

Let's take a look at an example to help understand the concept.

For demonstration purposes, we'll recreate the list of buttons in the image below

## Step 0: Creating a simple button component
First, we're gonna start off with the home button.
